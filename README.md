# python_automation_project
The Python automation project is a voice-controlled assistant. It uses libraries like pyttsx3 and speech_recognition to execute tasks based on user commands. It can open applications, search Wikipedia, browse the web, tell the time, and send emails.
The provided code represents a basic voice-controlled automation project implemented in Python. Here's an overview of the functionalities and the structure of the project:

1. **Importing Libraries**: The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech conversion, `speech_recognition` for recognizing speech input, `datetime` for retrieving current time, `wikipedia` for accessing Wikipedia articles, `webbrowser` for opening web pages, `os` for interacting with the operating system, and `smtplib` for sending emails.

2. **Initialization and Configuration**: The `pyttsx3` library is initialized with the 'sapi5' speech API, and the voice property is set to use the second voice available.

3. **Function Definitions**:
   - `speak(audio)`: A function to convert text to speech and speak it out loud.
   - `wishme()`: Greets the user based on the time of the day and prompts for user input.
   - `takecommand()`: Listens to the user's voice input using the microphone and converts it to text.
   - `sendEmail(to, content)`: Sends an email to the specified recipient with the given content.

4. **Main Execution**:
   - The `wishme()` function is
